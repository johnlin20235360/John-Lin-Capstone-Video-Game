## Roadmap
### Weeks 1-3
- Learn C# and begin work on a prototype of the game
- Basic WSAD movements, jumping, crouch, decent camera system to follow player movement inputs

- Begin working on the movement mechanics
- Start with speed sliding because that is the simplest movement mechanic I'll have
- Then begin to work on wall running
### Weeks 7-9
- Work on the ODM Gear (Omni directional grappling) - Learn the grappling code - instead of applying force to pull you towards a target, apply force from the WSAD movements

- This map will have a town as the starting point
- Several biomes (forests, mountains, deserts, etc.)
- Structures/Buildings around the map to parkour with
### Weeks 10-12

- Work on creating the different weapon classes along with their unique abilities
### Weeks 13-15
